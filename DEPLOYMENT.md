# ðŸš€ Quick Deployment Guide

## Netlify Deployment (Fixed)

The 404 error you encountered was because Netlify was looking for files in the wrong directory. This has been fixed by:

1. âœ… Moving all files to the root directory
2. âœ… Configuring `netlify.toml` correctly
3. âœ… Setting up proper redirects

## Steps to Deploy:

### 1. Commit and Push Your Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix deployment structure for Netlify"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Netlify
1. Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. **Important Settings:**
   - Build command: (leave empty)
   - Publish directory: `.` (root directory)
5. Click "Deploy site"

### 3. Verify Deployment
- Your site should now work without 404 errors
- The main page should load at `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`

## Firebase Setup (Required)

Before testing the app, make sure to:

1. **Enable Authentication** in Firebase Console:
   - Go to Authentication â†’ Sign-in method
   - Enable Email/Password

2. **Create Firestore Database**:
   - Go to Firestore Database
   - Create database in test mode
   - The app will automatically create collections

3. **Update Security Rules** (Optional):
   - Copy the rules from `firestore.rules` to Firebase Console

## Testing the App

1. **Register as an Employer**:
   - Create an account as "Employer"
   - Post some test jobs

2. **Register as an Employee**:
   - Create an account as "Employee"
   - Browse and apply for jobs

3. **Test the Workflow**:
   - Employers can accept/reject applications
   - Employees can track their application status

## Troubleshooting

If you still get 404 errors:

1. **Check Netlify Build Logs**:
   - Go to your site settings in Netlify
   - Check the "Deploys" tab for any build errors

2. **Verify File Structure**:
   - Ensure `index.html` is in the root directory
   - Check that `netlify.toml` is configured correctly

3. **Clear Cache**:
   - Sometimes Netlify caches old builds
   - Try triggering a new deploy

## Support

If you continue to have issues:
1. Check the Netlify build logs
2. Verify your Firebase configuration
3. Test locally first with a simple HTTP server

**Note**: The app is now properly configured for Netlify deployment and should work without 404 errors.
